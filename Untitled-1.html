        <h1>Dogs or Cats?</h1>
        <img src="cat-dog-together-lying-white-background-animal-themes-150098957.jpg" width="500">

<p>The world is made up of three types of people: Cat people; dog people; & boring people.</p>

<p>Why do you think you have a preference for one over the over?</p> 

<h2>Dogs</h2> 

<img src="download.jfif" width="100">

<p> The dog's story is inexorably linked with the human's. Dogs are dogs, and not wolves, purely because of human tampering. They were made by us to fit us. The same is true of almonds, but almonds don't play fetch. We took, and take, the cute ones, the sweet ones, the ones we like the best and mold them and their offspring, often to the detriment of their health, into our perfect companions. And that they are.</p>

<h2>Cats</h2>

<p> Cats are graceful, clumsy, silky soft with sharp edges, softly glowing eyes in the dark, purring, kneading balls of fur curled up closely against your body warmth, intellegent, annoying, funny, great conversationalists with comments about many things, and intriguing little creatures who display many emotions including affection, even love for their guardians.</p>
